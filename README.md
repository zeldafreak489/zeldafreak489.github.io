# PWA Prototype - Iris Perry

This is my PWA Prototype for my INF654VA class. It is a recipe app that allows users to create an anonymous account, share recipes, and save recipes.
When this is developed into a full PWA, users will be able to save recipes in their cookbook for offline use.

To view this website, you can either download the files and use Visual Studio Code to create a live server and view it.

Or, you can view the website at (https://zeldafreak489.github.io/)[https://zeldafreak489.github.io/]. I deployed the website using GitHub.
